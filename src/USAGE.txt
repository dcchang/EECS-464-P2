EECS 464: Hands-On Robotics 2020 Project 2 Cyan Team - USAGE

High level steps to follow:
-Open one terminal window
-In the terminal window run command: cd ~/p2
-In the terminal window run command: export PYGIXSCHD=pygame
-Run command: python myarmsim.py
-A pygame window will open. It will first appear black and may take a few seconds for graphics to appear (see below)
-Click on the pygame window
-Run calibration (see below)
-Run autonomous mode (see below)
-Press 'q' to save your results (see below) and quit program 
-Press ctrl+C in terminal to quit program without saving

What you should see when graphics appear:
-4 3D graphs showing different views of your arm (in gray) in the 3D workspace.
-A green rectangular prism within the workspace. This is the piece of paper.
-4 red dots on the surface of the paper, which represent the corners of a square.
-4 purple dots at the corners of the paper. These are the calibration points.

Current robot arm configuration is 3 motors with 3 arm segments. First motor is located at base of arm,
which is also the origin of the workspace, and is marked by a gray triangle. 
Rotation axes for each motor are the following:
Motor 1: z, Motor 2: y, Motor 3: y

Robot arm controls:
Make sure you have clicked on the pygame window before pressing any keys. Do not enter key preses in terminal.

Manual control:
Terminal message "manual move" will appear when moving robot arm manually.
-To increment each motor, press 'a','s',or 'd'. Each corresponds to each additional motor starting with the base motor.
-To decrement each motor, press 'z','x',or 'c'. Each corresponds to each additional motor starting with the base motor.

Calibration:
-Press 'k' to begin. The terminal message "Moving to calibration point" will appear and the robot arm will attempt
 to move to first calibration point.
-Once the arm has reached the point, the terminal message "Move complete" will appear.
-Manually move the end effector to the correct calibration point using manual control.
-Press 'o' to calculate error.
-Repeat previous steps, pressing 'k' again to move to next calibration point. Once you have done this process for 
every point, you will get the terminal message "Calibration complete!"

Autonomous mode:
This is where the arm will try to draw the edges of the square connecting the 4 corners.
-Press 'w','e','r','t' to move to each corner of the square. 

-'w': upper left corner
-'e': upper right corner
-'r': bottom right corner
-'t': bottom left corner

-To draw a complete square, you should press keys in order specified above and lastly repeat the first key press.
So do the following: 'w','e','r','t','w'.
-You can press keys in alternate orders, so long as you make sure to move between 
adjacent corners to draw the square edges. For example: 't','r','e','w','t' will also draw a square.

When each key is pressed and autonomy is started, terminal message "Move plan started!" will appear.
When the arm has finished moving to the desired corner, the terminal message "Move complete" will appear.
Wait till both these messages have popped up before pressing a different key to move to the next corner.

Results:
A csv file and png file will pop up in your directory.
-The csv file contains the x,y,z locations of the pen over time during the run.
-The png file shows the pen's drawing performance on the paper.
